# js-basics
A pile of uninteresting JS notes and (simple) scripts, loosely organized into folders. This is primarily a monorepo of tiny exercises.

Each script, unless otherwise noted, is self-contained and has no dependencies.

## Requirements
Most (probably all, depending on if I've kept the readme up to date) of these scripts run via Node. They can also run in the browser (output is generally to the console in both cases).

## Running
To run (why on earth are you wasting time doing that?):

`
$ ./node /<path>/<script.js>
`

## Notes
This isn't intended to useful as an example for anyone other than myself.
